# BuildCircle Instant Messaging

Welcome! This app is an instant messaging platform, using a rails server, react frontend, and the [pubnub SDK](https://www.pubnub.com/) to send and receive messages.

In order to run the app, make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

Once this is done, navigate to the root directory in your CLI and type the following command:

```
npm start
```

The server should now be up and running, and if your browser doesn't do so automatically, type in the url http://localhost:3001/ to get started. There are a few dummy accounts you can use to login, with names provided below. Otherwise, feel free to make a new account (note: please do not use a real password, as passwords are stored in plaintext).

Dummy accounts:

Usernames
- R2D2
- MarvinTheParanoidAndroid
- HAL
- T-1000
- WALL-E
- OptimusPrime

For every account:
Password
- password
